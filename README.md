"OBYS Agency Clone"- Web Design Project"

Hello everyone!

This project has been an great learning experience for me, while building this website, I have learnt a new CSS animations and Java script libraries like Gsap, Locomotive scroll, Shery JS which helped me to build flexible and dynamic  website. My main aim to develop this site was to get good grip on JavaScript. I have got to know this website through "Sheriyans Coding School" YT channel, This channel has been constantly helping me to get clear with fundamentals of web-development.
